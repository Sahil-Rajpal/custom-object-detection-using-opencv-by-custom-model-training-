# custom-object-detection-using-opencv-by-custom-model-training-


this is my first project using opencv and python.


in this project,we can detect custom objects by using a custom cascade file. cascade file is created by taking images as inputs.
we take two different types of images and will be named as positive and negative :- positive one is for the object we have to detect and negative one is for the images of the similar types or often considered along with them as group . negative images are the images ,we dont want to detect .


cascade file is created by using cascade trainer gui application
